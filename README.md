# The Pain of Finding GE‑Proton10‑5

## 😩 Why Did This Install Become a Quest?

- Released **June 29, 2025**, GE‑Proton10‑5 looked like a minor update—rebasing wine-wayland patches, removing the old mesa patch, and adding protonfixes for titles like Artificial Academy 2, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, Anno 1800, and Wuthering Waves.
- Just weeks later, due to crashing bugs triggered by those wine-wayland patches, the version was **force‑reverted** and **completely removed** from releases.

## ⚠️ What the Community Said

- SteamDeckHQ warned: “**GE‑Proton10‑5 version invalid** because of crash‑causing commits—better use 10‑6 or up”.  
- In AUR, users noted Proton‑GE10‑5 failure: “404 errors” and missing package entries—version skipped entirely, replaced by 10‑6 onward.  
- Reddit and forums echoed the sentiment: “better to stick with the latest version,” citing why 10‑5 disappeared.

|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| June 29, 2025 | **GE‑Proton10‑5 released** with new patches and fixes |
| ~July 1, 2025| **Version invalidated and removed** due to crash‑causing patch issues |
| Mid‑July 2025| Community warned to skip 10‑5; newer versions 10‑6/10‑7 available |

## 🤯 TL;DR – Why Was It So Painful?

1. **Released**, then **insta‑reverted**—it vanished overnight.  
2. The official GitHub releases skipped from 10‑4 to **10‑6**, no sign of 10‑5.  
3. Every installer (ProtonUp‑Qt / AUR / scripts) couldn't fetch anything—**404s all around**.  
4. Developer ended up recommending users to update to 10‑7 immediately.

## ✅ So What’s Actually Available Now?

- Use **GE‑Proton10‑6 or 10‑7**—they’re stable and supersede 10‑5.  
- If you see references to 10‑5 in older guides, it’s outdated and likely broken.  
- AUR packages confirm 10‑5 vanished and was skipped to force‑bump 10‑6/10‑7.

## Final Thoughts

> *Finding GE‑Proton10‑5 was like chasing a ghost—released, then deleted, leaving no trace. If you see a guide referencing it, assume it’s unreliable. Move on to Proton‑GE 10‑6 or 10‑7—they’re the ones that actually work.*

Happy troubleshooting.
